# JetB-Phone-Book
JetBrains: my next project.

The application implements several sorting and searching algorithms and compares their efficiency in dealing with a big dataset.
It uses a bubble sort, a quick sort, a linear search, a jump search, a binary search, and for comparison, a hash table.
Below is an example of the program's operation:

Start searching (linear search)...
Found 500 / 500 entries. Time taken: 0 min. 9 sec. 425 ms.

Start searching (bubble sort + jump search)...
Found 500 / 500 entries. Time taken: 1 min. 44 sec. 511 ms.
Sorting time: 1 min. 34 sec. 251 ms. - STOPPED, moved to linear search
Searching time: 0 min. 10 sec. 260 ms.

Start searching (quick sort + binary search)...
Found 500 / 500 entries. Time taken: 0 min. 9 sec. 76 ms.
Sorting time: 0 min. 9 sec. 68 ms.
Searching time: 0 min. 0 sec. 8 ms.

Start searching (hash table)...
Found 500 / 500 entries. Time taken: 0 min. 1 sec. 516 ms.
Creating time: 0 min. 1 sec. 515 ms.
Searching time: 0 min. 0 sec. 1 ms.
